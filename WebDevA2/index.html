        <h1>Moths!!!</h1>
        <p>The primary aim of this website is to provide education about the Marvellous Macrocosm of Moths. Traditionally, butterflies have been perceived as the "more aesthetically pleasing" counterparts to moths, a belief that has been ingrained in children from the tender age of two. Furthermore, with the release of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" by Eric Carle, this perception has nearly become a widely accepted viewpoint among the general populace, with the children's book serving as one of the most effective pieces of propaganda that attributes all the admiration to butterflies. Nevertheless, the moth community has gradually begun to challenge the prevailing belief that butterflies are superior to moths. As a modest representative of the moth community, I have created this website to highlight the intriguing characteristics that moths have developed over their 250 million years of existence and evolution. It is the least I can do to promote awareness of moths, and I sincerely hope you find the website enjoyable!</p>

            <h2>The Life Cycle of Moths</h2>
            <p>The life cycle of moths are straightforward and rather similar to the well-known life cycle of butterflies. Their cycle consists of the familiar stages of egg, larva, pupa and adult. However, one key difference between the butterfly's and moth's life cycle is that their pupae are named differently. A butterfly's pupa is called a chrysallis and made of a hardened layer of a caterpillar's skin, while a moth's pupa is called a cocoon and made out of silk.</p>

            <h2>Moth Behaviour</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, moths are not just "butterflies in night mode". The behavior of moths is varied and intriguing, involving defense, feeding, and navigation. They use pheromones to communicate, are mostly nocturnal, and are frequently drawn to light. Moths also use evasive movements and sound production as part of their camouflage and anti-predator tactics.</p>
            <p>Moths, as most people are aware, are nocturnal pollinators. During the night, they emerge from their sleep and flutter off to seek nocturnal flowers. When they find one, they unfurl their long proboscis, a straw-like mouth to help obtain the succulent nectar from the flower to eat. At the same time, the flower's pollen would gather on the moth's hairy legs, which will then spread and pollinate when the moth visits another nocturnal flower.</p>
            <img src="images/Pollination.jpg" width="300" alt="Pollination">
            <p>However, moths also have other features to their delicate, fuzzy little bodies. For example, certain species of moths are able to squeak. The squeaks are mostly used as a defence mechanism against predators. For exmaple, some moths are able to disrupt and/or jam a bat's sonar by producing ultrasonic squeaks. If not, they can also mimic the squeaks of toxic moths to discourage the bats from eating them.</p>
            <img src="images/moth-sonar-jam.jpeg" width="450" alt="Squeak">
            <p>There are also other strategies that moths use to deter bats. Many moths have evolved ears that can detect the ultrasonic squeaks of bats. Upon detecting them, the moths might start flying erratically, making sudden turns or performing aerial loops to escape the bat's pursuit. Still, if a bat gets too close to a moth, it can abruptly shut its wings and drop towards the ground, completely evading the bat's hungry mouth. </p>
            <img src="images/moth-dive.jpg" width="500" alt="Dive">
            <p>Still, squeaks are not limited to just defending onself from predators. The moths of the genus Acherontia, also more commonly known as the Death's-Head Hawkmoth, infiltrate beehives to steal and consume honey. However, bees can easily spot the moth and kill it before it can steal their honey. Thus, the Death's-Head Hawkmoth uses squeaks to mimic the sounds produced by the queen bee to fool the bees into thinking that it's one of them. This aids the Death's-Head Hawkmoth in its nightly honey theft, making it quite a nuisance towards beekeepers.</p>
            <img src="images/DeathheadHawkmoth.jpg" width="300" alt="Honey Theft">
            <p>Moth caterpillars still find a way to protect themselves. Notably, Luna Moth caterpillars will vomit a foul-tasting liquid as a defense mechanism against predators. Their repulsive "vomit" is actually a regurgitation of their intestinal contents, which serves as a deterrent to birds and other predators. Additionally, the caterpillars rub their mandibles together and make clicking sounds as a warning before throwing up. </p>
            <img src="images/large.jpg" width="300" alt="Luna Moth Caterpillar">
            <p>One trait of moths that makes them distguishable from butterflies is that their antannae, aka feelers, are feathery, threadlike, or comb-like, while the antannae of butterflies are typically long and thin, and are also club-shaped at the tips. Moths use their antannae for sensing their environment, acting as highly sensitive "noses" to detect airborne chemicals, including pheromones (to find mates) and scents from food sources.</p>

            <p>Now moving to more eerie facts about moths. Specifically, a certain moth's diet. The moths that belong to the genus Calyptra are known as "vampire moths". As the nickname suggests, these moths do indeed drink blood. While they primarily feed on fruit juices, some species have adapted to pierce the skin of mammals, including humans, and consume blood. These moths' proboscis are armoured, and they use it to pierce skin and suck blood. Not all Calyptra moths are blood feeders. Still, only some species, particularly males, have been observed to drink blood, and they are mostly found in certain parts of Europe and Asia.</p>

            <h2>Moths Portrayed In Media</h2>
            <h2>In Music:</h2>
            <p>Renowned Norwegian singer, AURORA, has prominently featured moths in her debut album "All My Demons
                Greeting Me As A Friend". She states that moths are the sisters of butterflies; they are brown, they are hairier, and nobody likes them, which is why she loves them and collects them when she finds them dead. She is fascinated by them because they fly at night, always looking for a place near the light. AURORA also finds the moths's nocturnal nature weird as they could be active during the day and not look for anything.</p>

            <h2>In Games:</h2>
            <p>In the open-world social game "Sky: Children Of The Light", new players are affectionately referred to as
                moths because their default avatar is given a brown cape that makes them look like the insect. The
                developers of Sky, "That Game Company", has taken notice of the term and made moth-themed outfits and
                accessories.</p>
